        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">About This Project</h2>
        <p class="fst-italic text-muted">
          Developed by <strong>Mayur Gorakh Chaudhari</strong>, this project
          leverages both Machine Learning and AI technologies to provide
          accurate and instant disease predictions.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üîç Two Powerful Prediction Methods</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. ML-Based Prediction:</strong> Built using a pre-processed
            Kaggle dataset with multiple CSV files (<em>training, description, symptoms, diets, medications,
              precautions,
              workout</em>). Implemented with
            <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong> for accuracy. Input
            includes
            <strong>Name, Age, Gender, and Symptoms</strong> (checkbox-based to
            avoid errors). Output is presented as a professional hospital-style
            report with disease details, description, recommended diet,
            medications, precautions, and workout tips. Users can also
            <strong>download the report</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. AI-Powered Prediction:</strong> Uses the
            <strong>Gemini API</strong> for intelligent, conversational disease
            diagnosis. Generates a detailed medical report including the
            predicted disease and medical advice, also downloadable in a
            hospital-style format.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üí¨ AI Doctor Chatbot</h4>
        <p>
          Integrated AI chatbot powered by the Gemini API that allows users to
          have an interactive consultation similar to talking to a doctor.
          Provides medical guidance, answers health-related queries, and
          recommends preventive measures.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üìÇ Medical Report Storage</h4>
        <p>
          The system includes a secure <strong>Medical Report Storage</strong> feature
          where users can save their generated reports for future access.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>üîí Reports are stored securely with user authentication.</li>
          <li>üìë Users can view their past reports anytime from their profile.</li>
          <li>‚¨á Reports can be downloaded or printed in a professional hospital-style format.</li>
          <li>üìä Acts as a digital health record for monitoring health history.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">‚öô Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Python (Flask Framework)</li>
          <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Machine Learning with SVM</li>
          <li>Gemini AI API for predictions and chatbot</li>
          <li>Pre-processed Kaggle Dataset</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üéØ Project Goal</h4>
        <p>
          The main aim of this project is to make disease prediction faster,
          more accessible, and reliable for users, without replacing
          professional medical advice. It combines the analytical power of ML
          models with conversational AI for better decision support in
          healthcare.
